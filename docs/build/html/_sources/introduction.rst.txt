------------------

1. NER - Named Entity Recogition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Named entity recognition (NER) , also known as entity chunking/extraction , is a popular technique used in information extraction to identify and segment the named entities and classify or categorize them under various predefined classes. These named entities typically represent real-world objects like people, places, organization, and so on, which are often denoted by proper names. See more details here :doc:`ner`.


2. Text Classification (BERT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Text classification is the process of assigning tags or categories to text according to its content. It’s one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection.


3. Sentiment Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis allows businesses to identify customer sentiment toward products, brands or services in online conversations and feedback.


4. Text Summarizer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Text summarization is the problem of creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary of a longer text document.

Automatic text summarization methods are greatly needed to address the ever-growing amount of text data available online to both better help discover relevant information and to consume relevant information faster.


5. Topic Modeling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that’s capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents.


6. Anomaly Detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.[1] Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.


7. Forecasting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Time series forecasting is modelled through a sequence of random values in a time series to estimate or predict next value. It is a hot topic which has many possible applications, such as stock prices forecasting, weather forecasting, business planning, resources allocation and many others.
